Git Hooks
=========

Symlink each of the files in the directory to .git/hooks. See 'Installation' below for help. 

The hooks will perform the following functions:

*pre-commit*
When you make a commit, this hook will run the GR Unit Test suite beforehand. If any test fails, then the commit is aborted. If you are REALLY SURE that you want to make a commit with failing tests, you can run `git commit --no-verify` and it will bypass this hook

*post-merge* 
When you merge one branch into the other or do a git pull, this hook runs `composer update` and `composer install` in order to update and install the PHP dependencies. It then runs `gr unit-test` to ensure that all your tests are still passing.

Installation
------------

```
$ cd .git/hooks
$ ln -s ../../git-hooks/pre-commit .
$ ln -s ../../git-hooks/post-merge .
$ cd ../..
```

You can verify that they're properly symlinked by running each of the following:

```
$ .git/hooks/pre-commit
$ .git/hooks/post-merge
```

and checking that the execute as expected.
